VCAC-vApps
==========

Deploy and configure VMware VCAC OVA's automatically

The 4 files here are an initial upload of scripts that can deploy and configure VMware VCAC OVA's using PowerCLI and the latest PowerCLI cmdlets for OVA's.

They are free to use. If you can add functionality, please do.

Please note that the script for configuring the VCAC Identity Appliance is not done yet.
